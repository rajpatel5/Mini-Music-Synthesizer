# Mini-Music-Synthesizer

A small synthesizer which develops clear, pleasent music. It uses several notes at various frequencies and also gives the user the ability to harmonize their music. The program can take in pre-existing files of music or the user can insert their own notes. It outputs a .wav file which can be opened on any operating system. The dusty.wav, minuet.wav files are just a couple of example of the output of this program

The program was coded in C. It makes splendid use of data structures, more specifically the Binary Tree. It implements the Karplus-Strong plucked string algorithm which attempts to simulate the physical behaviour of the sound-producing components of a musical instrument. The code has perfect use of pointers, it also provides the user with a list of possible frequencies they may use to create their own music.
